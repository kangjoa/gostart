# Proposal

## Problem:

- Each new Go project requires repetitive setup (go.mod, main.go, README, license, .gitignore).
- This leads to wasted time and inconsistent project structures.

## Solution:

- A CLI tool that instantly generates standardized, lightweight Go project boilerplate.

## Audience:

- Individual Go developers who want to save time when starting a new project.
- Teams who need consistent project structures across multiple repositories.
- Beginners who benefit from a ready-to-run project scaffold.
